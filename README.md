# Description of the project

This project is a sci-fi artifact of the the R2D2 robot which features in the star wars series and has captivated alot of star wars fans and I thought that it would be a good idea to build the robot in unity as a sci-fi artifact that has some movement functionality

# Instructions for use

To use this project you must first have a suitable unity version to run the project. You will then run the scene as a game and it will run in VR format with 2 separate screens and can also be used with an oculus VR headset if plugged in. Once the game scene has ran you can move the robot in a plane and to move the robot you can use AWSD to move the robot across the plane or you can use the arrow keys left and right to use R2D2's head

# How it works

The Robot has a few functionalities. He can move his head in a circular motion and can also move his body across the clear plane. You can use the right and left arrow keys to move the head of the robot and WASD to move the robot's body around.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

I am mostly proud of my learning experience that I gained from building this project, I participated in something I enjoy to make an artifact of a series of movies that I enjoy watching. I also learned how to use a variety of diffferent unity tools and packages to make the project as well as using blender was something new for me as I made the model in blender. I am most proud of my dilligence and hard work to get this done and for making a good project.
